# Introduction
* The experiments are seperated into two parts, one is based on the `English` corpus and another is based on `Chinese` one.<br>
* Five different algorithms are deployed to make comparison, one is convolution neural network, and other four are traditional machine learning approaches. Besides, data visualization approaches are used to illustrate the result of diversal models.<br>
* Codes of cnn model is based on [NLPproject_6.ipynb](https://github.com/siddarthhari95/NLP-Fake-News_detection/blob/master/NLPproject_6.ipynb) by siddarthhair95
# Dataset
* `Chinese corpus`: Data grabbed from Weibo. [Chinese_Rumor_Dataset](https://github.com/thunlp/Chinese_Rumor_Dataset)
* `English corpus`: Data are from William Yang Wang, "Liar, Liar Pants on Fire": A New Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection. 12.8K short texts are abstracted from PolitiFact.com, which provides detailed analysis report and links to source documents for each case.
